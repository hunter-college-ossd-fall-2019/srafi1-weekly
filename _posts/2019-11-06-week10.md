# Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert

My first thought from reading ["Makers and Takers"](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) by Dries Buytaert is that it is a more cynical, but pragmatic version of ["The Cathedral and the Bazaar"](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html). It defines "makers" as people that invest their time to contribute to open source software and "takers" as people that utilize open source software for their own benefit without contributing to it. The overall gist of the article is that makers keep the open source community afloat, but most companies would rather be takers because that role has more benefits. For open source software to be sustainable, there must be enough makers to support the takers. Overall, I think that some level of organization should be imposed on open source software to make sure that it can sustain itself, but not so much that it restricts the freedom contributors and maintainers. Privatization seems to strike this balance quite well so that money can be made off of open source software to support itself, but it can remain open source as a result. One point I don't agree with Buytaert on is that every technology company should become an open source company. Many companies use software that provides value solely based off of it being proprietary and I think those types of software should remain proprietary.

# Exploring Wikipedia Contribution

In class this week, we started talking about Wikipedia and how it is one of the most open open source projects. I started looking for places to contribute to it the same way I looked into contributing to OpenStreetMap: by looking local first. By doing so, I found two possible edits. The first is in the Demographics section of the [Borough Park page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_Park,_Brooklyn). The information listed under this section is from 2010, so I thought I could look for more recent census data. I then realized that the census is taken every 10 years and that the next one will be next year, so there is no new information to update this with. The other edit, however, is one I am sure I can make. The list of [Brooklyn Public Library Branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_Public_Library_branches) does not include an image for the Borough Park branch. I don't know if there are any images of the Borough Park branch library on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), but I can probably just take one myself and upload it.

# Progress on Hub

In class last Thursday, I found an issue to resolve for [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub). Issue [#2252](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/2252) is a feature request for being able to move an issue from one GitHub repository to another. This is a fairly simple feature and the main maintainer of Hub even included a framework for how to implement the feature ([here](https://github.com/mislav/hub-api-utils/blob/master/bin/hub-issue-transfer)), so I think I can tackle it. I commented on the issue asking if I could start work on it and got the green light.
