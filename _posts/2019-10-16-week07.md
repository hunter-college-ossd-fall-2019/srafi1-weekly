# Project Evaluations

I found the project evaluations to be somewhat tedious, but they revealed some valuable insights about the communities behind each project. I was originally split between working on Hugo or Hub, but decided on Hub after a brief look at each project. At first glance, they both seemed like great projects to work on, but Hub seemed easier to get started with because there were issues to be resolved regarding documentation. After evaluating the projects more throughly in this week's activities, I came to the same conclusion, but I am more confident in that decision. Most of the code that makes up Hugo is contributed by a small group of people and many of the pull requests opened by other people don't end up getting merged. Generally, the community behind Hugo is less welcoming than that of Hub.

# Contribution Progress

Last week, I decided that I would work on issue [#953](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/953) for the Yay project and then move on to working on Hub. I realized that I forgot to tell the community I meant to work on it, so I commented on the issue asking if anyone was already working on it or not and got the "go ahead" to work on it. I started reading the code and tracked down the relevant part of code to be the `install()` function in the `install.go` file. The only problem now is that this function is over 300 lines long, so I have to parse the entire function to figure out what to change.
